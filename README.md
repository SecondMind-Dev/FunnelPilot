[![Deploy to Render](https://render.com/images/deploy-to-render-button.svg)](https://render.com/deploy?repo=https://github.com/calebkotz/funnelpilot)

FunnelPilot is a portfolio-ready marketing automation showcase that pulls CRM segments from HubSpot, Salesforce, and Pipedrive, assembles AI-assisted outreach sequences, and launches them across email, LinkedIn, and SMS with a neon Second Mind aesthetic.

## ⭐ Why It Matters
- **Segment intelligence** – connectors normalize CRM audiences into one orchestration engine.
- **Heuristic strategist** – fatigue cooling, momentum boosts, and deliverability reroutes fire automatically and narrate their reasoning.
- **AI-assisted copy** – optional GPT hook gives each step bespoke tone, with deterministic fallback for demos.
- **Campaign scheduler** – APScheduler runs every 6h to ignite queued playbooks and log results.
- **Telemetry cockpit** – React + Tailwind UI mirrors the Second Mind theatre with heatmaps, timelines, and KPI decks.
- **Webhook theatre** – Slack digests and LinkedIn DM simulations broadcast the launch energy.

## 🧠 Stack
- **Backend:** FastAPI, APScheduler, Pydantic, httpx, uvicorn
- **Frontend:** Vite + React 18, Tailwind, Framer Motion, Recharts, lucide-react icons
- **Data:** JSON fixtures for segments, templates, campaign history
- **Testing:** pytest (unit/integration/e2e/performance/security), Playwright, Testing Library + Vitest snapshots
